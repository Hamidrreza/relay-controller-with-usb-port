### codes
This folder contains the python and arduino based atmega328 codes to run and use.<br>
this project can control 10 pin of arduino.<br>
Code examples are simple and just for controlling one I/O (pin 13). in future I'll complete it to use all ports.

- instead of atmega328 we also can use atmega8a because the pins are exactly the same.

# TODO:
- [ ] write codes for all I/O's
- [ ] make python gui
- [ ] make schematics for using
